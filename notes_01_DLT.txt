Idea: define dataset and DLT automatically keeps them up to dataset

Streaming tables(streaming live table): 
    A delta table that has a stream to write to it
    Read from append only data sources (kafka, auo loader)
    Guarantee to process each element once 

    Used for:
        Ingestion
        Low latency transformations
        On huge data that need to incrementally updated


    Definition:

        CREATE STREAMING TABLE report
        AS SELECT *
        FROM some query

    Since structured streaming calculate only new data changes to the past can be applied with full refresh:

        REFRESH report_table FULL

Materialized views(live table):

    The results of a query stored in a delta table
    Return the results of the query as was the last time updated
    Can be scheduled to refresh

    Used for:

        Transforming data
        Building aggregated tables
        Speed up BI queries and reports

    Defenition:

        CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW report
        AS SELECT *
        FROM some query


Expectations: data quality rules
    
    CONSTRAINT some_constraint
    EXPECT (rule)
    ON VIOLATION DROP/TRACK/ABORT

    Expectations can be specified in Materialized views
